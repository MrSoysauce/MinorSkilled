Relax state
- Patrolling:
	- Set path
	- Looks around at every point
- Sitting:
	- Idle at position
	- Return back to sitting position after chasing(!)
	- Polish: Get same rotation/pose back that you used to have

Hearing
- Trigger enemy, remember last spot he heard something
- Play animation (possible)
- Walk towards spot, whenever he sees player, follow player
- When it reaches spot and it hasn't seen the player, 
	play animation and return to patrolling

Seeing
- When enemy can see player, animation (scream?) -> chase him
- What he does when he gets close is up to the enemy type
- If he doesn't see the player anymore, play animation, then go back to relax

Special
- Ceiling
	- Doesn't do anything of the above, until it's dropped
	- If player is below it, let itself fall onto player
	- If player walks past it but close enough, falls as well
	- OPTIONAL: If the player walks past it, follow player on ceiling for a certain amount of time. Return back to standard place after
